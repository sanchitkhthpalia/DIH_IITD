                Digital India Hackathon is a national-level innovation challenge focused on Defence and DeepTech, designed to inspire, engage, and empower the next generation of developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts. This hackathon is a unique opportunity to build real-world, impactful solutions specifically for the Indian Armed Forces and national defence ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-5 text-justify">
                Unlike conventional hackathons, we are not looking for hypothetical or purely conceptual ideas. We are seeking practical, deployable, and innovative tech solutions that can directly support defence operations, security, logistics, intelligence, surveillance, training, and more. Whether it's a mobile app for field use, a web dashboard for command operations, or a DApp to ensure secure communication â€” if it helps our armed forces on the ground, it belongs here.

              <p className="text-justify">
                Join us in this mission to blend technology with patriotism. Collaborate, prototype, and pitch your defence-driven innovations in front of experts, mentors, and investors. Your idea could be the next big leap in strengthening our nation's security infrastructure.

                entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds, creating an ecosystem
                where meaningful connections can flourish. By uniting these
                creative minds, we aim to channel their skills toward solving
                real-world challenges and building innovative solutions. This
                Hack-a-thon provides an opportunity for participants to

                brainstorm ideas, and work together to develop cutting-edge
                solutions. The event will encourage participants to think beyond
                the scope of traditional problem-solving and tap into their
                entrepreneurial potential. The solutions they create could
                become the foundation for new ventures or even future companies.

                not only technical innovation but also a sense of community and
